                <p>There is one word that has made us different from any other church, <br />
                    and that is “PEMily.”  Whether you come from a Christian background <br />
                    or you’re skeptical about the church, we believe that you have a home <br />
                    and family at PEM. We invite you to worship with us and to feel the <br />
                    love of our Father, to know the grace of Jesus Christ, and to experience  <br />
                    the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
